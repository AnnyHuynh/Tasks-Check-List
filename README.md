## Motivation

I have been working as an accountant in several companies and I see the same issue in the accounting team in every company. The issue we have a lot of tasks during the month end closing time, and the tasks of one employee within the team relate to another. Sometimes they have to wait for others to complete the tasks before they can do their tasks. This app is created to help employees see the month end tasks progress and they don't have to send out multiple emails to ask others if the tasks have been completed. Moreover, manager can login to this app to track the progress of all tasks, and this make it easier for manager to monitor on employees's work. Finally, this app is also a good tracker to track all tasks and make sure all tasks are completed before the due dates and make sure employee don't miss any task. 

## Production Status
